## Overview

VisuoGen is a production-ready full-stack web application for AI-powered image and video generation. Built with a modern tech stack including React, Express.js, and PostgreSQL, it provides users with the ability to generate images using 15 different AI models across 4 providers, generate videos with 4 AI video models, manage their gallery, edit images with professional tools, share collections, and handle subscription-based credit systems with comprehensive admin controls.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript and Vite as the build tool
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui component library
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **Authentication**: Session-based authentication integrated with Replit Auth

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL
- **Database Provider**: Neon serverless PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: Replit OpenID Connect (OIDC) with Passport.js
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL storage

## Key Components

### Authentication System
- **Provider**: Replit OIDC for seamless integration with Replit platform
- **Session Storage**: PostgreSQL-backed sessions using connect-pg-simple
- **User Management**: Automatic user creation/updates on authentication
- **Admin Access**: Role-based access control for administrative features

### Database Schema

### Image Generation System
- **Multi-Model Support**: 12 operational AI models across 4 providers:
  - **OpenAI**: DALL-E 3 (high-quality, versatile generation)
  - **PiAPI**: Midjourney v6 (artistic, professional outputs)
  - **Stability AI**: Stable Diffusion XL (fast, reliable generation)
  - **Replicate**: 9 models including FLUX variants, Google Imagen-4, Minimax, Luma Photon, and specialized tools
- **Credit System**: Pay-per-generation model with subscription tiers and plan-based model access

- **Gallery Management**: Image browsing, favoriting, and organization
- **Subscription Portal**: Plan comparison and upgrade workflows
- **Admin Panel**: System management for plans, models, and users

## Data Flow

1. **Authentication Flow**: User authenticates via Replit OIDC → Session created → User record upserted
2. **Image Generation**: User selects model → Enters prompt → Credits deducted → Image generated → Stored in database
3. **Gallery Access**: User requests images → Database query with pagination → Images returned with metadata
4. **Subscription Management**: User views plans → Selects upgrade → Billing processed → Plan updated → Credits allocated

## External Dependencies

### Core Infrastructure
